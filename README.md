# planner
A printable weekly schedule (24 hrs./day) in 15-minute increments, designed for tracking where your time is spent.

## Contributing
Please feel free to improve and customize this however you would like to.  Pull requests for improvements to layout and function are greatly appreciated.

## Printing
I prefer to print this from Excel in portrait orientation (Letter size paper) with the left margin set to 0.15" and all other margins set to zero.  I also like to check the "Center Horizontally Box".

## Usage
I like to fill in a line every 15 minutes and record in pen what I've done.  I have a small timer on my phone [BlipBlip](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.nadolski.blipblip&hl=en) to help remind me.

I use pencil to plan ahead, and then erase the plans as reality happens, so I can use the space for logging my actual activities.

I use the narrow column under each day to record whether the activity was high, moderate, or low productivity.

I use the space at the bottom for making simple to-do lists.  I use the back of the page for taking notes on things I'm thinking about or working on.

I also plan to 3-hole punch each page as I finish and place it in a binder, in case I want to refer to it in the future.
